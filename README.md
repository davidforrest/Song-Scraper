# Song Scraper

`This is a program to be executed by a human, with some help from computers.`

Use [songs.json](https://github.com/davidforrest/Song-Scraper/blob/master/songs.json) for staging inserts until there’s a proper *New Music Tuesday* app.

Also, this is a [Learning Repo](https://github.com/davidforrest/A-Learning-Repo), so you can [follow its story](https://github.com/davidforrest/Song-Scraper/blob/master/steps/2020-05-03-2-resuscitating-the-chart-scrapers.md).
